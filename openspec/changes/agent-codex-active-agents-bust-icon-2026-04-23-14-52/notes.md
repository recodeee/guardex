# agent-codex-active-agents-bust-icon-2026-04-23-14-52 (minimal / T1)

Branch: `agent/codex/active-agents-bust-icon-2026-04-23-14-52`

Replace the Active Agents Activity Bar icon with a simplified bust-style silhouette so the sidebar reads closer to the sculpted logo direction from the reference image while still fitting VS Code's small monochrome icon constraints.

Scope:
- Replace `vscode/guardex-active-agents/media/active-agents-hivemind.svg` with a bust-style Activity Bar icon.
- Mirror the same SVG update into `templates/vscode/guardex-active-agents/media/active-agents-hivemind.svg`.
- Bump `vscode/guardex-active-agents/package.json` and `templates/vscode/guardex-active-agents/package.json` to `0.0.15` so the workspace install/reload path can pick up the new asset cleanly on top of current `main`.
- Keep `.vscode/settings.json` aligned with `main`; do not ship workspace icon-theme drift as part of this icon-only lane.
- Keep runtime/session logic untouched.
- Do not fake a red numeric Activity Bar badge in code; the current `TreeView.badge` surface only exposes `value` and `tooltip`, not per-view badge color/severity.

Verification:
- Manual diff check of both mirrored SVG assets.
- Confirm both extension manifests stay in sync at `0.0.15`.
- Confirm the extension still points at the same `media/active-agents-hivemind.svg` path in shipped/template manifests.
- Confirm the current badge code still uses `TreeView.badge` count + tooltip only.
- Confirm `.vscode/settings.json` stays out of the final diff.

## Handoff

- Copy prompt: Continue `agent-codex-active-agents-bust-icon-2026-04-23-14-52` on branch `agent/codex/active-agents-bust-icon-2026-04-23-14-52`. Work inside the recovery sandbox, keep the new icon readable at Activity Bar size, keep manifests synced at `0.0.15`, and do not reintroduce workspace icon-theme changes.
