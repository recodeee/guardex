## Definition of Done

This change is complete only when **all** of the following are true:

- Every checkbox below is checked.
- The agent branch reaches `MERGED` state on `origin` and the PR URL + state are recorded in the completion handoff.
- If any step blocks (test failure, conflict, ambiguous result), append a `BLOCKED:` line under section 4 explaining the blocker and **STOP**. Do not tick remaining cleanup boxes; do not silently skip the cleanup pipeline.

## 1. Specification

- [x] 1.1 Finalize proposal scope and acceptance criteria for `doctor-recursive-nested-repos`.
- [x] 1.2 Define normative requirements in `specs/nested-repo-doctoring/spec.md`.

## 2. Implementation

- [x] 2.1 Implement scoped behavior changes.
- [x] 2.2 Add/update focused regression coverage.

## 3. Verification

- [x] 3.1 Run targeted project verification commands (`node --check bin/multiagent-safety.js` plus a direct end-to-end repro: parent repo + nested frontend repo on protected `main`, then `gx setup`, drift, `gx doctor`, and `gx scan --target <frontend>`).
- [x] 3.2 Run `openspec validate doctor-recursive-nested-repos --type change --strict`.
- [x] 3.3 Run `openspec validate --specs` (repo returned `No items found to validate.`).

## 4. Cleanup (mandatory; run before claiming completion)

- [ ] 4.1 Run the cleanup pipeline: `bash scripts/agent-branch-finish.sh --branch agent/codex/fix-recursive-doctor-nested-protected-ma-2026-04-21-11-51 --base main --via-pr --wait-for-merge --cleanup`. This handles commit -> push -> PR create -> merge wait -> worktree prune in one invocation.
- [ ] 4.2 Record the PR URL and final merge state (`MERGED`) in the completion handoff.
- [ ] 4.3 Confirm the sandbox worktree is gone (`git worktree list` no longer shows the agent path; `git branch -a` shows no surviving local/remote refs for the branch).
