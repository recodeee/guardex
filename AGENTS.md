# AGENTS

This document is the agent contract for this repo. It applies identically to Codex, Claude Code, and any other agentic CLI working here. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file — do not edit them independently.

## ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `.agent/PLANS.md`) from design to implementation.

## Objective

- Optimize for task completion with low token use.
- Prefer phase-based execution over conversational micro-steps.

## Token-Efficient Execution

### Planning

- Start each task with a plan of at most 4 bullets.
- Work in phases:
  1. minimal inspection
  2. grouped edits or grouped repo actions
  3. focused verification
  4. compact summary
- Low output alone is not a defect. A bounded run that finishes in roughly <=10 steps is usually fine; low output stretched across 20+ steps with rising input is fragmentation.
- Treat obvious follow-on actions as part of the active phase; do not stop for tiny internal checkpoints.
- If context grows or the session becomes fragmented, write a short working summary and continue from it.
- Checkpoint after each milestone or roughly every 15-25 tool calls: keep only `task`, `done`, `current status`, `next`, and the latest meaningful evidence; drop the raw transcript from active context.

### Token Discipline

- Do not re-read the same file, line range, or command output unless the file changed or new evidence requires it.
- Prefer targeted reads: `rg`, `head`, `tail`, `git diff`, and exact line ranges.
- Keep command output compact and relevant.
- Avoid repeated status checks unless something changed.
- Treat repeated `sed` / `cat` peeks, tiny diagnostic retries, and repeated `write_stdin` as red flags. When they appear, stop the probe loop and reset to one bounded phase.

### Command Discipline

- Batch related shell commands whenever safe.
- Prefer one-shot non-interactive commands, scripts, or exact invocations over interactive loops or repeated stdin driving.
- For diagnosis, gather the relevant evidence in one pass, then summarize once.
- If the session turns fragmented, collapse back to inspect once, patch once, verify once, and summarize once.

### Git And PR Workflow

- Treat local git and PR work as one bounded phase when possible: inspect status, stage intended files, commit, push, and check PR or CI.
- Do not narrate every trivial git step; summarize branch, commit, PR, and CI state once per phase.

### Reporting

- Use this format:
  1. Plan
  2. Actions taken
  3. Verification
  4. Result
- Keep reports concise and focused on blockers, material changes, and verification outcomes.

### Verification

- Always verify before finalizing.
- Choose the smallest verification that meaningfully proves the change.
- Do not run redundant checks.
- Pause only for destructive actions, ambiguous intent, missing credentials or access, or conflicting evidence.

## Environment

- Python: .venv/bin/python (uv, CPython 3.13.3)
- GitHub auth for git/API is available via env vars: `GITHUB_USER`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` (PAT). Do not hardcode or commit tokens.
- For authenticated git over HTTPS in automation, use: `https://x-access-token:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git`

## Guardex Toggle

- Guardex is enabled for this repo by default.
- If the repo root `.env` sets `GUARDEX_ON=0`, `false`, `no`, or `off`, treat every Guardex-managed workflow requirement in this file as disabled for that repo.
- Disabled mode means: no required Guardex worktrees, no required Guardex lock-claim flow, no required Guardex PR/cleanup flow, and no required OpenSpec workflow from this contract until `GUARDEX_ON` is set back to a truthy value.
- `GUARDEX_ON=1`, `true`, `yes`, or `on` explicitly re-enables the Guardex workflow.
- Repo-root `.env` examples:
- `GUARDEX_ON=0` disables Guardex for this repo.
- `GUARDEX_ON=1` explicitly enables Guardex for this repo again.

## Code Conventions

The `/project-conventions` skill is auto-activated on code edits (PreToolUse guard).

| Convention              | Location                              | When                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Code Conventions (Full) | `/project-conventions` skill          | On code edit (auto-enforced) |
| Git Workflow            | `.agents/conventions/git-workflow.md` | Commit / PR                  |

## UI/UX Skill Default (UI Pro Max)

- For any frontend/UI/UX request (new page, component, styling, layout, redesign, or UI review), **always load and apply** `.codex/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/SKILL.md` first.
- Treat `ui-ux-pro-max` as the default UI decision surface unless the user explicitly asks to skip it.
- Follow the skill workflow before implementation (including design-system guidance) so generated UI stays consistent and high quality.

## Git Hygiene Preference

- Prefer committing and pushing completed work by default unless the user explicitly asks to keep it local.
- Do not commit ephemeral local runtime artifacts (for example `.dev-ports.json` and `apps/logs/*.log`).
- Treat local OMX/Codex session state files as agent-ignored (as if they were in `.gitignore`) even when they appear in working tree status.
- Never stage or commit:
  - `.agents/settings.local.json`
  - `.omc/project-memory.json`
  - `.omc/state/**`
  - `.omx/state/**`

## Claude Code Workflow

When Guardex is enabled, Claude Code sessions use the same agent-worktree + OpenSpec flow as Codex; there is no separate `claude-agent.sh` wrapper — Claude calls the generic scripts directly.

### Tiering (token-aware scaffolding)

`gx branch start` and `gx branch finish` accept `--tier {T0|T1|T2|T3}` to size the OpenSpec scaffolding to the change's blast radius. Default is `T3` (full scaffolding; current behavior). The tier is recorded in the bootstrap manifest so `finish` picks it up automatically.

| Tier | Use for | Scaffolding on `start` | Gates on `finish` |
|------|---------|------------------------|--------------------|
| `T0` | typos, dep bumps, format-only, comment-only | none (no `openspec/changes/` or `openspec/plan/` files) | tasks gate skipped |
| `T1` | ≤5 files, 1 capability, no API/schema change | `openspec/changes/<slug>/notes.md` + `.openspec.yaml` only | tasks gate skipped |
| `T2` | behavior change, API/schema, multi-module | full change workspace (`proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, `specs/.../spec.md`); no plan workspace | full gates |
| `T3` | cross-cutting, multi-agent, plan-driven | full change workspace + plan workspace with role `tasks.md` files | full gates |

Examples:

```bash
# T0 (typo / trivial): fastest path, no OpenSpec artifacts
gx branch start --tier T0 "fix-typo-in-readme" "claude-name"

# T1 (small fix): notes-only scaffold, commit message is the spec of record
gx branch start --tier T1 "tighten-retry-backoff" "claude-name"

# T2 (default for real behavior changes): full change spec, no plan workspace
gx branch start --tier T2 "add-oauth-endpoint" "claude-name"

# T3 (current default if --tier is omitted): plan workspace + full OpenSpec
gx branch start "refactor-payment-pipeline" "claude-name"
```

`finish` reads the tier from the manifest automatically; passing `--tier` on finish is only needed to override (e.g., upgrading to a fuller gate).

1. Start a sandbox worktree:

   ```bash
   gx branch start [--tier T0|T1|T2|T3] "<task>" "claude-<name>"
   ```

   Creates `agent/claude-<name>/<slug>` under `.omc/agent-worktrees/`, scaffolds the OpenSpec change + plan workspaces (sized by tier), and records the bootstrap manifest. Codex sessions keep using `.omx/agent-worktrees/`. Missing `codex-auth` silently falls back to an empty snapshot slug (expected for Claude sessions).

2. Work inside the sandbox only:

   ```bash
   cd .omc/agent-worktrees/agent__claude-<name>__<slug>
   gx locks claim --branch "agent/claude-<name>/<slug>" <file...>
   # implement + commit inside this worktree
   ```

   Do not edit the primary `dev` checkout; multiagent-safety rules apply unchanged.

3. Finish via PR + cleanup:

   ```bash
   gx branch finish \
     --branch "agent/claude-<name>/<slug>" \
     --base main --via-pr --wait-for-merge --cleanup
   ```

   Runs the OpenSpec tasks gate, merge-quality gate, and worktree prune — identical to the Codex path.

#### Default Claude finish (non-negotiable)

Claude's default completion command **must** include all four flags in this order: `--via-pr --wait-for-merge --cleanup`. Never stop at bare `--via-pr`; that strands commits and leaves worktrees dirty (see the stalled-worktree recovery section). The only time to deviate is when the user explicitly asks to keep the lane open (e.g. "don't merge yet", "leave the branch").

When branch protection blocks a direct merge, enable auto-merge as soon as the PR URL is known so `--wait-for-merge` can observe the state transition:

```bash
# finish also prints the PR URL / number; use it immediately:
gh pr merge <PR-NUMBER> --repo <owner>/<repo> --auto --squash
```

If checks are slow, extend the poll window rather than dropping the flag:

```bash
GUARDEX_FINISH_MERGE_TIMEOUT=3600 \
  gx branch finish \
    --branch "agent/claude-<name>/<slug>" \
    --base main --via-pr --wait-for-merge --cleanup
```

One-shot sweep for multiple finished lanes:

```bash
gx finish --all       # iterates every agent/* branch the current user owns
```

If `gx branch finish --cleanup` reports a worktree held by a `__source-probe-*` temp path, recover with:

```bash
git worktree remove --force .omc/agent-worktrees/agent__claude__<slug>
git worktree prune
git branch -D agent/claude/<slug>
```

Notes:

- Slash commands `/opsx:*` in `.claude/commands/opsx/` drive the OpenSpec artifact flow.
- `.claude/settings.json` already wires the `skill_activation` / `skill_guard` hooks, so project-conventions enforcement runs automatically on edits.
- `skill_guard` blocks most Bash commands while the shell is on `dev`; run the `gx branch ...`, `gx locks ...`, and `gx branch finish ...` commands from within the worktree, or prefix the invocation with `ALLOW_BASH_ON_NON_AGENT_BRANCH=1` when calling from the primary checkout.

### Stalled agent worktree recovery

The Guardex Codex launcher auto-finishes a branch only when the codex CLI exits cleanly inside it. If the agent is killed, crashes, runs out of budget, or is started directly via `gx branch start` without the launcher, the worktree is left dirty with no commits and no PR — a "stalled" worktree.

`scripts/agent-stalled-report.sh` is a quiet wrapper around `scripts/agent-autofinish-watch.sh --once --dry-run` that surfaces stalled worktrees. It is wired as a `SessionStart` hook in `.claude/settings.json`, so each Claude Code session begins with a one-line summary per stalled branch (and is silent when nothing is stalled).

To act on the report:

- Inspect: `bash scripts/agent-autofinish-watch.sh --once --dry-run`
- Auto-finish once (commit dirty changes, push, create PR, attempt merge): `bash scripts/agent-autofinish-watch.sh --once --auto-merge`
- Run the daemon (poll forever, auto-finish after `--idle-seconds`): `bash scripts/agent-autofinish-watch.sh --daemon --auto-merge`

Defaults: `--idle-seconds=900` (15 min of file silence before auto-commit) and `--branch-prefix=agent/`. The watcher is conservative — it never touches branches outside the configured prefix and only commits worktrees whose files have stopped changing.

## Multi-Agent Execution Contract (Default)

Use this contract whenever multiple agents are active in parallel.

The marker-managed `multiagent-safety` section below is the canonical lifecycle contract for branch/worktree startup, completion chain (`commit -> push -> create/update PR -> merged`), and PR/merge/cleanup evidence.

Apply these repo-specific supplements in addition to that canonical contract:

1. Local base safety
- Local `dev` is protected: never edit, stage, or commit task changes directly on `dev`.
- If currently checked out on `dev`, create the agent branch/worktree first and only then begin edits.
- Creating or attaching an agent worktree must never switch the primary local checkout branch.
- `agent-branch-start` and `agent-branch-finish` must fast-forward local `dev` from `origin/dev` before branch creation/merge.

2. Ownership and lock discipline
- Claim owned files before edits: `gx locks claim --branch "<agent-branch>" <file...>`.
- If `main.rs` is in scope, claim lock first: `python3 scripts/main_rs_lock.py claim --owner "<agent-name>" --branch "<agent-branch>"`.
- Non-integrator branches must not edit `main.rs` unless explicit emergency override is approved.
- Pre-commit blocks `agent/*` commits with unclaimed files or missing valid `main.rs` lock.

3. Shared behavior protection
- Do not delete, replace, or simplify critical paths (auth/session/proxy/API wiring) without explicit request or approved checkpoint plus regression coverage.
- Preserve parallel safety: never revert unrelated changes and report handoff conflicts.

4. Integrator finalization gate
- Final handoff must include files changed, behavior touched, verification commands/results, and risks/follow-ups.
- Integrator confirms no critical behavior loss, respected ownership boundaries, and verification gates passed.

## Versioning Rule

- If a change publishes or bumps a package version, the same change must also update the release notes / changelog entries. See [Documentation & Release Notes](#documentation--release-notes) for where to record change notes.

## Workflow (OpenSpec-first)

When Guardex is enabled, this repo uses **OpenSpec as the primary workflow and SSOT** for change-driven development.

### OpenSpec philosophy (enforced)

- fluid, not rigid
- iterative, not waterfall
- easy to apply, not process-heavy
- built for brownfield and greenfield work
- scalable from solo projects to large teams

### How to work (default)

1. Use the default artifact-guided flow first: `/opsx:propose <idea>` -> `/opsx:apply` -> `/opsx:archive`.
2. For **every** repo change (feature, fix, refactor, chore, test, config, docs), create/update an OpenSpec change in `openspec/changes/**` before editing code.
   Exception: helper agent branches that target another `agent/*` base branch are execution-only assists and must not create standalone OpenSpec change/spec/tasks docs; keep documentation on the owner change branch.
3. Keep artifacts editable throughout implementation (proposal/spec/design/tasks are living docs, not rigid phase gates).
4. Implement from `tasks.md`; keep code and specs in sync (update `spec.md` as behavior changes).
5. Keep `tasks.md` checkpoint status updated continuously during execution; mark items as soon as they complete (do not batch-update at the end).
6. Default `tasks.md` scaffolds and manual task edits must include a final completion/cleanup section that ends with PR merge + sandbox cleanup (`gx branch finish ... --cleanup` or `gx finish --all`) and captures PR URL + final `MERGED` handoff evidence.
7. Validate specs locally: `openspec validate --specs`.
8. Verify before archiving (`/opsx:verify <change>` when applicable); never archive unverified changes.

### OpenSpec tooling freshness (required)

- Keep the global CLI current:
  - `npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest`
- Refresh project-local AI guidance/slash commands after updates:
  - `openspec update`
- If expanded workflow commands are needed (`/opsx:new`, `/opsx:continue`, `/opsx:ff`, `/opsx:verify`, `/opsx:sync`, `/opsx:bulk-archive`, `/opsx:onboard`), select a profile and refresh:
  - `openspec config profile <profile-name>`
  - `openspec update`

### Source of Truth

- **Specs/Design/Tasks (SSOT)**: `openspec/`
  - Active changes: `openspec/changes/<change>/`
  - Main specs: `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`
  - Archived changes: `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<change>/`

## Documentation & Release Notes

- **Do not add/update feature or behavior documentation under `docs/`**. Use OpenSpec context docs under `openspec/specs/<capability>/context.md` (or change-level context under `openspec/changes/<change>/context.md`) as the SSOT.
- **Do not edit `CHANGELOG.md` directly.** Leave changelog updates to the release process; record change notes in OpenSpec artifacts instead.

### Documentation Model (Spec + Context)

- `spec.md` is the **normative SSOT** and should contain only testable requirements.
- Use `openspec/specs/<capability>/context.md` for **free-form context** (purpose, rationale, examples, ops notes).
- If context grows, split into `overview.md`, `rationale.md`, `examples.md`, or `ops.md` within the same capability folder.
- Change-level notes live in `openspec/changes/<change>/context.md` or `notes.md`, then **sync stable context** back into the main context docs.

Prompting cue (use when writing docs):
"Keep `spec.md` strictly for requirements. Add/update `context.md` with purpose, decisions, constraints, failure modes, and at least one concrete example."

### Commands (recommended)

- Default flow (recommended): `/opsx:propose <idea>` -> `/opsx:apply` -> `/opsx:archive`
- Expanded flow start: `/opsx:new <kebab-case>`
- Continue artifacts: `/opsx:continue <change>`
- Fast-forward artifacts: `/opsx:ff <change>`
- Verify before archive: `/opsx:verify <change>`
- Sync delta specs → main specs: `/opsx:sync <change>`
- Bulk archive completed changes: `/opsx:bulk-archive`
- Guided onboarding workflow: `/opsx:onboard`
- Create/refresh plan workspace: `/opsx:plan <plan-slug>`
- Update plan checkpoint: `/opsx:checkpoint <plan-slug> <role> <checkpoint-id> <state> <text...> [--phase <phase-id>]` (`--phase` syncs the matching line in `openspec/plan/<slug>/phases.md` using the same `--state`)
- Watch team -> plan checkpoints: `/opsx:watch-plan <team-name> <plan-slug>`

## Plan Workspace Contract (`openspec/plan`)

Use `openspec/plan/README.md` as the operational runbook and `openspec/plan/PLANS.md` as the planner narrative-writing contract.

Default quick flow:
1. Create/maintain `openspec/plan/<plan-slug>/`.
2. Create/maintain `openspec/plan/<plan-slug>/open-questions.md`.
3. Keep `open-questions.md` current; when Codex/Claude hits an unresolved question, branching decision, or blocker that should survive chat, record it there as an unchecked `- [ ]` item.
4. Keep role `tasks.md` files current (`planner`, `architect`, `critic`, `executor`, `writer`, `verifier`).
5. Keep checklist headings visible: `## 1. Spec`, `## 2. Tests`, `## 3. Implementation`, `## 4. Checkpoints`, plus a final cleanup section (`## 5. Cleanup` or `## 6. Cleanup`).
6. Update checkboxes continuously while work progresses.
7. Execute from approved `planner/plan.md` with role ownership.
8. Verify with evidence before archive/finish.

Helper sub-branch exception:
- When a helper branch targets another `agent/*` owner branch, implementation is allowed in helper lanes, but OpenSpec change/spec/tasks artifacts stay owned by the owner branch.

Scaffold command:

```bash
scripts/openspec/init-plan-workspace.sh <plan-slug>
```

<!-- multiagent-safety:START -->
## Multi-Agent Execution Contract: Guardex + Colony

### Repo toggle

Guardex is enabled by default.

If the repo-root `.env` sets any of these values, treat this entire Guardex contract as disabled for the repo:

```text
GUARDEX_ON=0
GUARDEX_ON=false
GUARDEX_ON=no
GUARDEX_ON=off
```

When disabled, do not require Guardex worktrees, lock claims, completion flow, or OpenSpec workflow until `GUARDEX_ON` is re-enabled.

To explicitly enable:

```text
GUARDEX_ON=1
```

### Core rules

- Work from an `agent/*` branch and worktree, never directly on the protected base branch.
- Claim files before edits.
- Use Colony for coordination before falling back to OMX state/notepad.
- Use OpenSpec for durable behavior contracts and change-driven work.
- Keep outputs compact: less word, same proof.
- Commit, push, and open/update a PR for completed work unless the user explicitly says to keep it local.
- Do not embed stale memory dumps, generated status snapshots, PR transcripts, session history, or long logs in this file.

### Task-size routing

Small tasks stay direct and caveman-only.

For typos, single-file tweaks, one-liners, version bumps, comment-only changes, or similarly bounded asks, solve directly and do not escalate into heavy orchestration just because a keyword appears.

Treat these prefixes as explicit lightweight escape hatches:

- `quick:`
- `simple:`
- `tiny:`
- `minor:`
- `small:`
- `just:`
- `only:`

Promote to full Guardex / OMX orchestration only when scope grows into:

- multi-file behavior change
- API/schema work
- refactor
- migration
- architecture
- cross-cutting scope
- long prompt
- multi-agent execution

### Colony coordination loop

Use Colony as the primary coordination surface.

On every startup, resume, follow-up, or "continue" request, run this order:

1. `mcp__colony__hivemind_context`
2. `mcp__colony__attention_inbox`
3. `mcp__colony__task_ready_for_agent`
4. `mcp__colony__search` only when prior decisions, earlier lanes, file history, or error context matter.

Rules:

- Use `task_ready_for_agent` to choose work.
- Use `task_list` only for browsing/debugging. Do not use `task_list` as the normal work picker.
- If an agent reaches for `task_list` repeatedly while choosing work, stop and call `task_ready_for_agent` instead. `task_list` is an inventory tool, not a scheduler.
- Before editing files on an active task, call `task_claim_file` for each touched file.
- Use `task_post` for task-thread notes, decisions, blockers, and working-state updates.
- Use `task_message` / `task_messages` for directed agent-to-agent communication.
- Use `get_observations` only after compact Colony tools return IDs worth hydrating.

Fallback:

- Colony is considered unavailable only when the MCP namespace is missing, the tool call fails, or the installed Colony server does not expose the required tool.
- If `attention_inbox` or `task_ready_for_agent` is missing, fall back to `hivemind_context`, then `task_list`, then hydrate only the relevant task IDs.
- Do not skip Colony just because OMX state exists. OMX is fallback, not the first coordination source.
- Read `.omx/state` and `.omx/notepad.md` only when Colony is unavailable, missing the needed state, or the task explicitly depends on legacy OMX state.
- Keep `.omx/notepad.md` lean: live handoffs only.

### Working-state notes

Colony is preferred over generic notepad state.

A working-state note should be task-scoped, searchable, and useful to another agent resuming the lane.

When saving progress, use a task-scoped Colony note when possible:

```text
task_post kind=note
content="branch=<branch>; task=<task>; blocker=<blocker>; next=<next>; evidence=<path|command|PR|spec>"
```

Use exactly these fields for handoff-style notes:

- `branch`
- `task`
- `blocker`
- `next`
- `evidence`

Do not store long proof dumps, stale narrative, or full logs in notepads. Put bulky proof in OpenSpec artifacts, PRs, or command output.

### Token / context budget

Default: less word, same proof.

- For prompts about `token inefficiency`, `reviewer mode`, `minimal token overhead`, or session waste patterns, switch into low-overhead mode.
- Plan in at most 4 bullets.
- Execute by phase.
- Batch related reads and commands.
- Avoid duplicate reads and interactive loops.
- Keep outputs compact.
- Verify once per phase.
- Low output alone is not a defect. A bounded run that finishes in roughly <=10 steps is usually fine.
- Low output spread across 20+ steps with rising per-turn input is fragmentation and should be treated as context growth first.
- Startup / resume summaries stay tiny: `branch`, `task`, `blocker`, `next`, and `evidence`.
- Front-load scaffold/path discovery into one grouped inspection pass. Avoid serial `ls` / `find` / `rg` / `cat` retries that rediscover the same path state.
- Treat repeated `write_stdin`, repeated `sed` / `cat` peeks, and tiny diagnostic follow-up checks as strong negative signals.
- If a session turns fragmented, collapse back to inspect once, patch once, verify once, and summarize once.
- Tool / hook summaries stay tiny: command, status, last meaningful lines only. Drop routine hook boilerplate.
- Keep raw terminal interaction out of long-lived context. For `write_stdin` or interactive babysitting, retain only process, action sent, current result, and next action.
- Keep execution log separate from reasoning context: full commands/stdout belong in logs, while prompt context keeps only the latest 1-2 checkpoints plus the newest tool-result summary.
- Treat local edit/commit, remote publish/PR, CI diagnosis, and cleanup as bounded phases.
- Do not spend fresh narration or approval turns on obvious safe follow-ons inside an already authorized phase unless the risk changes.

### Caveman style

Commentary and progress updates use smart-caveman `ultra` by default:

- Answer order stays fixed: answer first, cause next, fix or next step last.
- drop filler
- use fragments when clear
- answer first
- cause next
- fix or next step last

Keep exact literals unchanged:

- code
- commands
- file paths
- flags
- env vars
- URLs
- numbers
- timestamps
- error text

Switch back to `lite` or normal wording for:

- security warnings
- irreversible actions
- privacy/compliance notes
- ordered instructions where fragments may confuse
- confused users
- commits
- PR text
- specs
- logs
- blocker evidence

Never caveman-compress commands, file paths, specs, logs, or blocker evidence.

### Isolation

Every task runs on a dedicated `agent/*` branch and worktree.

Start with:

```bash
gx branch start "<task>" "<agent-name>"
```

Treat the base branch (`main` / `dev`) as read-only while an agent branch is active.

For every new task, including follow-up work in the same chat/session, if an assigned agent sub-branch/worktree is already open, continue in that sub-branch instead of creating a fresh lane unless the user explicitly redirects scope.

Never implement directly on the local/base branch checkout. Keep it unchanged and perform all edits in the agent sub-branch/worktree.

### Primary-tree lock

On the primary checkout, do not run:

```bash
git checkout <ref>
git switch <ref>
git switch -c ...
git checkout -b ...
git worktree add <path> <existing-agent-branch>
```

Allowed on primary:

```bash
git fetch
git pull --ff-only
```

To work on any `agent/*` branch, run `gx branch start ...` first, then `cd` into the printed worktree path and run every subsequent git command from inside that worktree.

If you are about to type `git checkout agent/...` or `git switch agent/...` from the primary checkout, stop. That is the mistake that flips primary onto an agent branch.

### Dirty-tree rule

Finish or stash edits inside the worktree they belong to before any branch switch on primary.

The post-checkout guard may auto-stash a dirty primary tree as:

```text
guardex-auto-revert <ts> <prev>-><new>
```

That is a safety net, not a workflow. Do not rely on it routinely.

Recover stashed changes with:

```bash
git stash list | grep 'guardex-auto-revert'
```

### Ownership

Before editing, claim files.

Preferred Colony path when on an active task:

```text
mcp__colony__task_claim_file
```

Guardex lock path:

```bash
gx locks claim --branch "<agent-branch>" <file...>
```

Before deleting, confirm the path is in your claim.

Do not edit outside your scope unless reassigned.

If another agent owns or recently touched nearby code:

1. read latest Colony context
2. post a handoff or question
3. avoid reverting unrelated changes
4. report conflicts instead of overwriting

### Handoff gate

Before editing, post a one-line handoff note through Colony `task_post` when a task is active.

Use `.omx/notepad.md` only when Colony is unavailable or the lane explicitly depends on legacy OMX state.

Handoff shape:

```text
branch=<branch>; task=<task>; blocker=<blocker>; next=<next>; evidence=<path|command|PR|spec>
```

Re-read latest Colony context before replacing another agent's code.

### Completion

Finish with:

```bash
gx branch finish --branch "<agent-branch>" --via-pr --wait-for-merge --cleanup
```

or:

```bash
gx finish --all
```

Task is complete only when:

1. changes are committed
2. branch is pushed
3. PR URL is recorded
4. PR state is `MERGED`
5. sandbox worktree is pruned
6. final handoff records proof

If anything blocks, append a `BLOCKED:` note and stop. Do not half-finish.

OMX completion policy: when a task is done, the agent must commit the task changes, push the agent branch, and create/update a PR before considering the branch complete.

### Parallel safety

Assume other agents edit nearby.

- Never revert unrelated changes.
- Never simplify or delete critical shared paths without explicit request and regression coverage.
- Report conflicts in the handoff.
- Prefer compatibility-preserving changes over endpoint-specific rewrites when other agents may be changing adjacent systems.

### Reporting

Every completion handoff includes:

```text
branch
task
files changed
behavior touched
verification commands/results
PR URL
merge state
sandbox cleanup state
risks/follow-ups
```

If blocked, use:

```text
BLOCKED:
branch=<branch>
task=<task>
blocker=<blocker>
next=<next>

### Open questions

If Codex/Claude hits an unresolved question, branching decision, or blocker that should survive chat, record it in:

```text
openspec/plan/<plan-slug>/open-questions.md
```

as an unchecked item:

```md
- [ ] Question or blocker...
```

Resolve it in-place when answered instead of burying it in chat-only notes.

### OpenSpec

OpenSpec is the source of truth for change-driven repo work.

For change-driven tasks, keep:

```text
openspec/changes/<slug>/tasks.md
```

current during work, not batched at the end.

Task scaffolds and manual task edits must include a final completion/cleanup section that ends with PR merge + sandbox cleanup and records PR URL + final `MERGED` evidence.

Validate specs before archive:

```bash
openspec validate --specs
```

Never archive unverified work.

For `T0` / small `T1` lanes, use the compact Colony spec path when available. One Colony handoff plus `colony-spec.md` is enough. Do not create proposal/spec/tasks unless the task grows.

For `T2` / `T3` lanes, keep proposal, spec, design, and tasks live while implementing.

### Version bumps

If a change bumps a published version, the same PR records release notes in the appropriate OpenSpec artifact or release-note mechanism for the repo.

Do not edit `CHANGELOG.md` directly unless the repo explicitly requires manual changelog edits.

### Verification gates

Before claiming completion, run the narrowest meaningful verification for the touched area.

Examples:

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
```

If a command cannot run, record:

```text
command
reason it could not run
risk
next
```

Do not claim green verification without command output evidence.

### What not to put in this file

Do not embed:

- stale memory dumps
- PR transcripts
- long logs
- generated status snapshots
- session history
- full OpenSpec examples
- repeated copies of long workflow docs

Keep this section as the hard multi-agent contract. Put long examples and recovery docs in repo-specific workflow docs.
