# GuardeX (Codex skill)

Use this skill whenever branch safety, lock ownership, or guardrail setup may be broken.

## Fast path

1. Run `gx status`.
2. If repo safety is degraded, run `gx doctor`.
3. If issues remain, run `gx scan` and address the findings.

## Setup path

If guardrails are missing entirely, run:

```sh
gx setup
# alias
gx init
```

Then verify:

```sh
gx status
gx scan
```

## Operator notes

- Prefer `gx doctor` for one-step repair + verification.
- Keep agent work isolated (`agent/*` branches + lock claims).
- For every new user message/task, restart the full loop on a fresh agent branch/worktree.
- For one-command Codex sandbox startup, use `bash scripts/codex-agent.sh "<task>" "<agent-name>"`.
- `scripts/codex-agent.sh` auto-syncs the sandbox branch against base before each task and auto-finishes merge/PR flow after Codex exits.
- Auto-finish keeps the branch/worktree by default; remove merged branches explicitly with `gx cleanup` (or `gx cleanup --branch "<agent-branch>"`).
- Do not bypass protected branch safeguards unless explicitly required.
